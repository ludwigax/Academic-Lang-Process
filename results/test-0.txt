phene is expected to endow polymer composites with ultrahigh thermal conductivities, which can be even similar to those of some metals such as stainless steel and aluminum alloy. The thermal conductivities of composites prepared by dispersing multilayer graphene (MLG) in epoxy matrix increase only by an order of magnitude over the improvement has been limited since the large interfacial thermal resistance exists between graphene and the surrounding epoxy. We have reported an extraordinary increase in thermal conductivity of through the fabrication of the vertically aligned and densely packed MLG in the epoxy matrix. The ultrahigh thermal conductivity of 33.54 W/(m K) has been achieved in the aligned MLG/epoxy composite (AG/E). The thermal conductivity of AG/E exhibits a positive temperature response related to the aligned structure while increasing the temperature from 40 °C to 90 °C. 

Eﬃcient heat conductivity and heat removal play a vital role for the long service life and high performance of electronic and photonic devices.1,2 In recent years, signiﬁcant attention has been focused in developing high thermal conductivity composite materials utilizing graphene, because of its extraordinarily high in-plane thermal conductivity, large speciﬁc surface area, and high mechanical strength. For instance, the thermal conductivity of graphene has been reported to be ∼5000 W/(m K) at room temperature.3 

Enhanced thermal conductivities of the composites over the neat polymers have been achieved by the disordered dispersion of multilayer graphene (MLG) in the polymer matrix.4−9 However, the improvements are very limited, because of the large thermal resistances that exist in the interfacial regions of MLG and polymer.10 So far, the best thermal conductivity of <5.5 W/(m K) has been reported for the composites containing MLG as ﬁller.11 The thermal resistance usually becomes higher at elevated temperature and this phenomenon is named as the negative temperature response, since the thermal expansions of polymer matrix widen the gaps between contact regions of MLG. This always leads to reduce the thermal conductivity of the composite materials.11,12 Therefore, the desired thermal conductive composite based on MLG are expected to possess not only ultrahigh thermal conductivity but also positive temperature response. 

Aligned carbon nanostructure ﬁllers in polymer matrix are expected to be an eﬃcient way to enhance the thermal conductivity of the resulting composites due to the presence of minimum thermal resistance along the aligned direction.13−16 fabricated aligned CNT/polymer nano- Marconnet et al. composites using in situ injection of polymers into CNT arrays and obtained the axial thermal conductivity of 4.87 W/(m K) with 16.7 vol % CNTs, which is much greater than the reported values of unaligned CNT-based composites.17 

If MLG materials can be vertically stacked in the polymer matrix and assembled interconnected as a network, the thermal conductivity of the composites would be greatly improved. Unfortunately, until now, such inspiring composite structures have not been demonstrated. This is due to the ﬂexible structure of the MLG, which may allow it to transform to complex shapes with diﬀerent forms during the composite preparation. The vertically aligned free-standing MLG in polymer composites in large scale is very diﬃcult to realize for the ﬂexible nature of ultrathin two-dimensional MLG. 

Herein, we report a facile and scalable route to fabricate new composites by assembling the aligned and interconnected MLG in an epoxy matrix. The resulting composite exhibits the highest 

thermal conductivity of MLG/epoxy composites, compared to the previously reported values. We also found a novel positive temperature response of the thermal conductivity. The anisotropic thermal conductivities and temperature response are attributed to the aligned structure in the composites. 

Samples Preparation. MLG (GRF-HQ-P-001, size = 30−80 μm, thickness = 3−5 nm) was obtained from Suzhou Graphene Nanotechnology Co., Ltd., China. The obtained MLG (1.0 g) was dispersed by ultrasonication (∼10 min) in a 1-L solution of ethanol and water (with a volume ratio of 4:1). Then, the dispersions were vacuum-ﬁltrated (with a polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) membrane, pore size = 0.2 μm), and self-assembly of the aligned MLG (AG) bulk occurred during the ﬁltration process. The AG bulk was immersed into the mixture of epoxy monomer (diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol F, EPON 862, Hexion) and curing agent (diethyltoluenediamine, EPI- CURE) with weight ratio of 4:1 for 1 h under vacuum. After the curing cycle at room temperature for 24 h and at 120 °C for additional 2 h, the AG/E was obtained. For comparison, the dispersed MLG/epoxy composite (DG/E) was also prepared by dispersing the MLG into the epoxy matrix. The MLG (1.0 g) was dispersed in the mixture (8.47 g) of epoxy and curing agent (weight ratio of 4:1) for 30 min under vacuum. DG/E was obtained after curing at room temperature for 24 h and at 120 °C for an additional 2 h. 

Measurements and Observations. The morphology of the cryo- fractured surface was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (Quanta 400 FEG, FEI, USA). The composition of the MLG was evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, coupled with SEM). Raman spectroscopy was recorded at LabRam HR 800 UV NIR using a 633-nm laser excitation with working distances on a 50× lens. A Raman spectrum of the MLG was taken by depositing the sample on glass slides. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic study was performed on a FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet Model 6700, USA) to identify the functional groups present on the MLG. The amount of MLG in the composite was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), using Thermal Analyser Exstar TG/DTA 6200 (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/ min. The tensile samples were prepared according to ASTM D-638. The tensile properties were measured on the hydraulic universal material testing machine Instron 3365 (Instron Corporation, USA) with a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min. The thermal conductivities of the composites were measured by a thermal conductivity tester DRL- III (Xiangyi Instruments, China) designed according to ASTM D5470- 06, and the applied pressure in the test was 0.04 MPa. Before the measurement, the disk-shaped composite specimens 3 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in thickness were coated with thermal grease (the thermal conductivity is 0.6 W/(m K)). The thermal expansion of the samples in the temperature range from 30 °C to 100 °C was tested using thermomechanical analysis (TMA) (Model TMA 402 F1/F3 Hyper- ion, Netzsch, Germany) at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and a preload force of 0.02 N. The electrical conductivity of the AG/E was measured on an Aglient B1500A multimeter equipped with a two-point probe testing stage. Electrical conductivity was calculated from obtained current−voltage data and sample dimensions. 

Fabrication of the AG/E. In order to prepare AG/E comprising of vertically aligned and densely packed MLG in the epoxy matrix, we developed an easy fabrication process (Figure 1a). Typical SEM image of the MLG shows a rumpling and scrolling morphology (Figure 2a). It reveals the high quality and intact structure of MLG and is proved by the EDS patterns shown in Figure 2b. From the Raman spectrum of the MLG in Figure 2c, a sharp G-peak at 1583 cm−1, a weak D-band at 1335 cm−1, and a 2D-band at 2960 cm−1 are observed. The intensity

ratio of the D-peak to the G-peak (ID/IG) is ∼0.2, suggesting almost no defects in MLG. As illustrated in Figure 2d, the FTIR spectrum of the MLG is almost featureless, conﬁrming the low content of defects in the MLG. 

9.6 cm and a thickness of 6.0 cm in Figure 1b.


The MLG was dispersed in an ethanol/water solution. The MLG dispersions were subjected to vacuum ﬁltration to assemble MLG into closely packed and aligned bulk. Then, epoxy monomers were inﬁltrated into the gaps between the MLG layers in the premade, macroscopic AG bulk. After the cure cycle, we succeeded in making the AG/E. A photograph is shown for the AG/E prepared in large scale with a diameter of 9.6 cm and a thickness of 6.0 cm in Figure 1b. 

Characterization of MLG in the AG/E. SEM analysis reveals the cross-sections of AG, AG/E, and DG/E. As shown in Figures 3a and 3b, aligned structures are successfully obtained via the vacuum-assisted self-assembly. The laminated structure of MLG is evident in large scale, which exhibits a strong anisotropic alignment of MLG between parallel and perpendicular directions. The MLG dispersions play a vital role in aﬀecting the alignment of MLG in the ﬁltration process. Eﬀects of diﬀerent solvents have also been investigated in the present work. The ethanol/water solution was chosen to form appropriate gaps between MLG layers during vacuum ﬁltration to allow the inﬁltration of epoxy monomers (see Figure 3, as well as Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In contrast to the conventional DG/E (prepared from dispersion of disordered MLG in epoxy), the SEM image of AG/E indicates the presence of a highly ordered structure of MLG in the epoxy matrix (see Figures 3c and 3d). The SEM image of AG/E exhibits a brick-and-cement arrangement. The MLG looks like stacks of ultrathin bricks to form a “wall” with interconnected layers, while the epoxy act as a cement component ﬁlled in the gaps between MLG layers. The brick-and-cement arrangement ensures good interactions between the epoxy and the MLG, which may endow the composite with excellent mechanical and thermal properties. 

The MLG content in the composites was evaluated from the TGA plot (Figure 3e). It can be seen that pure MLG is thermally very stable, and almost no mass loss occurs upon heating up to 800 °C. However, the curves of pure epoxy and

AG/E show the step weight losses between 310 °C to 550 °C that are due to the thermal degradation of epoxy chains. The amount of weight loss is lower for the AG/E, compared to the pure epoxy, whereas the onset degradation temperature of the composite (signiﬁes the thermal stability) is slightly higher than the pure epoxy. This is ascribed that the epoxy intimately surrounding the graphene degrade at a slower rate, causing the degradation to shift to higher temperature.18,19 The MLG content in the AG/E has been calculated by considering the weight loss in pure epoxy from 400 °C to 700 °C, which is noted to be ∼11.8 wt %. The high MLG content can provide multiple conductive paths for the electron and phonon. 

The typical tensile stress−strain curves of the AG/E are shown in Figure 3f. The tensile strength of the pure epoxy is 38.6 MPa, which decreases to a signiﬁcant extent by the addition of 11.8 wt % MLG in epoxy.20 The decrement in tensile strength is characteristic of the high loading of graphene, because of the huge contacting interface between two phases and the aggregation of graphene.21−23 It is advantageous for the thermal conductivity of the composites in the high content of graphene at which the graphene can come into contact with each other to form a conducting network. The AG/E exhibits a tensile strength of 14.5 MPa in parallel direction, which is three times higher than that in the perpendicular direction (4.4 MPa), and two times higher than the DG/E (7.7 MPa). A tensile strength and distinct contrast between parallel that an eﬃcient perpendicular alignment can optimize parallel tensile strength of AG/E to a remarkable degree. Stress−strain curves of the composites provide further evidence of this anisotropy of AG/E. 

Thermal Conductivity of the AG/E. In order to evaluate the thermal properties of the AG/E, thermal conductivities of the composite in parallel and perpendicular directions were measured. As shown in Figure 4b, there is a distinct contrast between parallel thermal conductivity (16.75−33.54 W/(m K)) 

and perpendicular thermal conductivity (5.43−7.55 W/(m K)) of AG/E, which suggests that an eﬃcient alignment enables ultrahigh thermal conductivity of AG bulk in the parallel direction. The thermal conductivity for the DG/E with the similar amounts of MLG has been found to be 1.84 W/(m K) (an order of magnitude lower than AG/E in parallel direction). The thermal conductivity of AG/E in the parallel direction, so is the highest for graphene-based polymer composites, far, which is much higher than those of the epoxy-based composites containing other ﬁllers (see Figure 5, as well as Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), and can be higher than some metals such as stainless steel (16.7 W/(m K)) and bronze (26.2 W/(m the ﬁllers in thermally conductive K)). The eﬃciency of materials is characterized by the thermal conductivity enhance- ment (TCE), which is deﬁned as − 

where K is the thermal conductivity of the composite and Km is the thermal conductivity of the matrix material.11 Table 1 summarizes previously reported thermal conductivity enhance- ment for epoxy composites with various ﬁllers. The data show that the measured thermal conductivity enhancement in AG/E is indeed extremely high. The AG/E possesses a TCE value (∼16670%) higher than that of other epoxy composites. 

Figure 4b shows an unusual trend of temperature depend- ence thermal conductivity of the AG/E in parallel direction, which has been seldom reported previously. There is an extraordinary increase in thermal conductivity in the parallel direction for the AG/E from 40 °C to 90 °C. MLG content remaining same, K reaches the value of 33.54 W/(m K) at 90 °C, which corresponds to an eﬃciency of 16670%. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity values reported in Figure 4c provide reproducible results without any change up to three heating/cooling cycles ranging between 40 °C and 90

°C. This suggests good thermal stability in this temperature range. However, the measured perpendicular thermal con- ductivity is low and remains almost consistent with the temperature. The controlled experiments conﬁrm that align- ment of MLG is essential for increasing thermal properties of epoxy composite. Thermal conductivity with positive temper- the optimum ature response of AG/E prepared under conditions is promising as the next generation of thermal conductive materials. 

The improved thermal conductivity of the composite is also accompanied by increasing electrical conductivity. The volume electrical resistance of AG/E was measured by a two-terminal probe method, and the resistivities of the composites are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. Compared to the DG/E, a remarkable reduction in resistivities can be seen in 

anisotropic trend in the resistivities is less signiﬁcant, which is quite diﬀerent with that of the thermal conductivities in parallel and perpendicular directions as reported earlier. This is due to the diﬀerence in the mechanism between thermal and electrical conductivities.31,32 

The experimental results clearly demonstrate huge enhance- ment in thermal conductivity and the positive temperature response through the aligned MLG as the ﬁller in AG/E. To account for the observed behavior, we consider the eﬀective 

medium theory model and thermal expansion properties. Eﬀective medium theory has been used to model the thermal the thermal conductive ﬁllers/polymer conductivities of composites in parallel and perpendicular directions.33 The AG is generally modeled as laminated ﬂat plates with a large aspect ratio. For laminate composites, a matrix containing parallel ﬂat plate inclusions is oriented perpendicular to the X3 axis (Figure 4a). 

The eﬀective medium approximations are modiﬁed to the improved analytical equations including the eﬀect of thickness of MLG, orientation distribution, volume fraction, interfacial thermal resistance, and thermal conductivities of ﬁllers and matrix on the thermal conductivity of the AG/E (see the Supporting Information).

volume fraction of particles, θ the angle between the materials axis X3 and the local particle symmetric axis; Rbd the thermal boundary resistance, and h the thickness of the MLG sheets. In the case of AG/E, Kp/Km was taken to be ∼3000 for thermal conductivity of the MLG to epoxy matrix and Rbd values for graphene as 7.7 × 10−8 K m2/W.34,35 Figure 4d presents the theoretical thermal conductivity of the AG/E versus θ calculated based on eqs 2 and 3. It is found that the high thermal conductivities of AG/E can be achieved in the parallel direction at θ ≤ 25°, which is in accordance with the morphological observation of the sample (Figure 3c). The evaluated values of theoretical thermal conductivities within the small θ for the AG/E can be consistent with the expermental results in the parallel direction. Each AG layer in the composite is arranged as a parallel conduction medium and provides direct graphene−graphene conduction to form conductive chains. 

The model reveals the direct correlation between the thermal conductivities and the ﬁller content, predicting that a low AG content can also achieve high thermal conductivity of

composite. In order to take full advantage of the high thermal conductivity of each MLG, additional studies on the AG/E are the quality of MLG necessary including improvement of alignment, contact regions between MLG, MLG-polymer boundary resistance.17 The constituent MLG must be consistently well-aligned, which is hard to achieve in fabricating composites. Contact regions between MLG also play an important role in determining the high thermal conductivity of the composite. 

It is believed that the aligned structures of MLG in epoxy and thermal expansion properties of the components are respon- thermal sible for the anisotropic temperature response of conductivity. With increasing temperature, thermal expansion leads to the improved alignment and packing density of MLG along with the eﬀective increment in the contact region between MLG and epoxy. Thus, the thermal conductivity in parallel direction shows an evident increase, with respect to temperature. Thermal expansion experiments were performed to check the thermal expansion as a function of temperature for the three types of epoxy composites (Figure 6a). All the curves show increased thermal expansion with increasing temperature, and the diﬀerent reductions of thermal expansion can be seen in AG/E and DG/E, because of the assembled formations of incorporating MLG. 

The AG/E exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion behavior in parallel and perpendicular directions and it can be correlated with the results obtained from the thermal conductivity measurement and morphological analysis. More signiﬁcant reduction of thermal expansion has been observed in perpendicular direction. We attribute the suppression of the volume change to the alternative layer structure between MLG layers and epoxy in the interstitial space. The previous report has revealed that the thermal expansion of graphene remains negative in the entire temperature range with a room temperature value of −8.0 × 10−6 K−1 (error of ±0.7 × 10−6 K−1).36 The thermal expansion coeﬃcient of epoxy is ∼50.0 × 10−6 K−1 (error of ±0.7 × 10−6 K−1).37 Thus, the MLG layers contract as the temperature rises and play a role of blocking the expansion of epoxy present within the MLG layers. The opposite expansion coeﬃcients and the blocking role would be responsible for the unobvious volume change in perpendicular direction. Moreover, the relatively small reduction of thermal expansion in parallel direction can also be understood from the interactional biaxial tensile in a tangential direction, because of the opposite expansion coeﬃcients between epoxy and MLG. The tensile strain further improves the alignment along the parallel direction and the more impacted stacking of MLG (Figure 6b). In contrast to the thermal expansion of AG/E, the 

capacity of expansion of DG/E falls between those of AG/E in the parallel and perpendicular directions. The relatively small improve the expansion of DG/E is isotropic and cannot alignment and stacking of MLG in epoxy. The situation is similar to that of the dispersed-ﬁller-based composites, which hinders the process of conductive paths, because of the widening of the gaps between conducting particles at high temperature.38 Deagglomeration or breakage of the conducting paths has been examined by the inﬂuence of thermal expansion of the matrix in a series of conductive ﬁller-based polymer composites. 

A thermal conductivity composite was developed with aligned multilayer graphene (aligned MLG, or AG) in epoxy matrix. Its ultrahigh thermal conductivity exceeds to that of other ﬁller- based epoxy materials. The aligned MLG/epoxy composite (AG/E). also exhibits the increment in thermal conductivity from 16.75 W/(m K) to 33.54 W/(m K), as a function of temperature ranging from 40 °C to 90 °C. The remarkable improvement is due to the unique alignment in structure of MLG. The eﬃcient heat transmission of the composite at elevated temperature makes it potentially suitable for the novel thermal management applications.
